# Leon Template - First HTML & CSS Project 🚀

Welcome to my first project using **HTML** & **CSS**, based on the **Leon template** tutorial by Eng. Osama Elzero. In this project, I followed along with the video to replicate the Leon template design while learning the fundamentals of HTML and CSS.

- 📱 Making the template responsive across different devices.

### Features ✨:
